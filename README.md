Argo consists of a set of open source tools for deploying and running applications and workloads on Kubernetes, including:

* [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/): Kubernetes-native workflow engine supporting DAG and step-based workflows.
* [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/): Declarative continuous delivery with a fully-loaded UI.
* [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/): Advanced Kubernetes deployment strategies such as Canary and Blue-Green made easy.
* [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/events/): Event based dependency management for Kubernetes.

In addition, [argoproj-labs](https://github.com/argoproj-labs) is a separate GitHub org for community contributions related to the Argo ecosystem.
